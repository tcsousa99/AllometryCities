# AllometryCities

Project based on my internship at the Center for Theoretical and Computational Physics of the Faculty of Sciences of the University of Physics. This project focuses on a study of how the "city size" influences the number of suicides and homicides in Portugal and Brasil, expecting of course, to extrapolate to other regions.
